## Build

### Single Architecture Build
To build the Docker image for your current architecture:

```bash
docker build -t ansible_docker .
```

### Multi-Architecture Build (ARM64 + AMD64)
To build for both ARM and x86 platforms using Docker Buildx:

```bash
# Create and use a new builder instance
docker buildx create --name multiarch --use

# Build and push multi-architecture image
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -t rotecodefraktion/ansible_docker:secure \
  -t rotecodefraktion/ansible_docker:latest \
  --push .

# Optional: Remove builder when done
docker buildx rm multiarch
```

**Note:** Currently the image on Docker Hub is ARM64 only. Multi-architecture support coming soon.

## Usage

### Security Notice ðŸ”’
The `:secure` tag includes comprehensive security improvements including:
- Fixed Ubuntu 24.04 LTS version
- Removed default SSH keys (mount at runtime)
- Limited sudo access
- Enabled SSH host key verification
- Pinned dependency versions (CVE-2024-26130 fixed)

### Quickstart from Docker Hub

**Secure version (recommended):**
```bash
docker run -it -d --name ansible_docker rotecodefraktion/ansible_docker:secure
```

**With persistent storage and SSH keys:**
```bash
docker run -v /tmp/docker_ansible:/install/ansible \
           -v ~/.ssh:/home/ansible/.ssh:ro \
           -it -d --name ansible_docker \
           rotecodefraktion/ansible_docker:secure
```

You can create a fresh ssh key-pair with ssh-keygen inside the container or you can use your own ssh key from outside the container. To copy your own ssh-key to the container:

```bash
docker cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa ansible_docker:/home/ansible/.ssh/
docker exec -u 0 -it ansible_docker chown ansible:ansible /home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa
docker exec -it ansible_docker /bin/zsh
```

### Build your on image

```bash
git clone ttps://github.com/davidkrcek/docker_ansible.git
docker build -t ansible_docker .
docker run -it -d --name ansible_docker ansible_docker
```

The container will start with the zsh shell, and you will be in the working directory for Ansible.

## Dockerfile Contents

  - zsh
  - ohmyzsh
  - git
  - sudo

- Environment Variables: Configures user and directories for Ansible.
- User Creation: Creates a new user ansible and configures its environment.

- Python and Ansible: Installs Python3, pip, and Ansible within a Python virtual environment.
- SSH Configuration: Copies SSH keys and configurations to the home directory of the Ansible user.

## Configuration

To customize the configuration, modify the corresponding environment variables in the Dockerfile.

- ANSIBLE_USER: ansible or any other user inside the container which connects to the satellites
- ANSIBLE_USER_UID: 1002 or any other id, helps to read/write attached filesystems to the container
- ARG ANSIBLE_HOME: /home/ansible
- ANSIBLE_WORKDIR: attached directory from host to container

- Copy all ssh keys (private keys) from ./config/ssh_keys to ANSIBLE_HOME/.ssh/

  **Please use a allways a secret when generating private keys**

- If you build the docker image behind ZScaler or similar you can upload the necessary certificates to ./conifg/cacerts
  to avoid git certifcates errors
